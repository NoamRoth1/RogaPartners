# Data Analysis Project - Roga Partners

Dear Recruiter,

I would like to share with you a recent data analysis project I completed at Roga Partners. The project involved performing various data analysis tasks on multiple Excel files using Python and the pandas library. I believe this project showcases my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and problem-solving, and I am excited to share the details with you.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to extract valuable insights from several Excel files containing different data sets. I utilized Python and the pandas library to read and manipulate the data, and conducted thorough data analysis to answer specific questions.

## Key Tasks

Here are the key tasks I performed during the project:

1. **Data Acquisition**: I read data from multiple Excel files, including `data.xlsx`, `State.xlsx`, `Agent.xlsx`, and `HireDate.xlsx`, using Python's pandas library. This allowed me to access and integrate data from various sources.

2. **Data Analysis**: Based on the provided questions, I conducted in-depth data analysis using pandas. This involved manipulating the data, performing calculations, and deriving meaningful insights. I ensured that the analysis was accurate, efficient, and well-documented.

3. **Results Presentation**: I organized and presented the results in a clear and concise manner. The analysis outcomes were printed to the console, allowing easy interpretation of the findings. I also created an `merged.xlsx` file during the analysis process, which stored the merged data for further reference.

## Running the Project

To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files from the provided repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure that you have Python (version 3.x) and the pandas library installed on your machine.
4. Execute the main Python script, `script.py`, by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```shell
   python script.py
   ```

5. The script will perform the data analysis tasks and display the results on the console.

## Project Files

The project directory contains the following files:

- `script.py`: The main Python script that performs the data analysis tasks.
- `data.xlsx`: Excel file containing the primary data set.
- `State.xlsx`: Excel file providing additional state information.
- `Agent.xlsx`: Excel file containing information about the agents.
- `HireDate.xlsx`: Excel file containing the hire date information.
- `merged.xlsx`: Excel file created during the analysis process, storing merged data.

Please feel free to explore the project files and modify the script as needed. I have provided clear documentation within the code to assist in understanding and extending the functionality.

## Additional Notes

Here are a few additional notes regarding the project:

- The project assumes that the necessary Excel files (`data.xlsx`, `State.xlsx`, `Agent.xlsx`, `HireDate.xlsx`) are located in the same directory as the Python script.
- The results of each data analysis question are displayed in the console output, enabling easy interpretation of the findings.
- During the analysis process, the script may create or modify the `merged.xlsx` file, which stores the merged data set.

I hope this overview of my recent data analysis project at Roga Partners provides you with valuable insights into my skills and capabilities. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to discussing this project in more detail with you.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Noam Roth
